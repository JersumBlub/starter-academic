abstract: "This paper estimates the timing of identifying students with disabilities when students are race matched to their teachers. Early identification is vital for students that need additional resources to ensure a proper education. Delaying proper education for even a year may have drastic consequences on the trajectory of a student’s future. I utilize a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the timing of identifying students with disabilities based on whether the student is race matched to their teacher or not. "
