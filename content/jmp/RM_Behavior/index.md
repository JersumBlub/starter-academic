title: "The Student-Teacher Race Match Effect on Learning Skills and Behavioral Outcomes"

abstract: "I provide evidence that diversifying the labor supply of teachers to better reflect the racial distribution
of students increases learning and behavioral outcomes for students of color without diminishing
outcomes for white students. I use administrative data spanning from 2007 to 2017 within the Los
Angeles Unified School District, one of the most racially diverse school districts in the country, to
measure the effect of student-teacher race matching on various noncognitive outcomes. I mitigate
the concern that race matches are endogenous by including school-grade and student fixed effects
into a linear regression model. This setting accounts for any potential sorting that occurs across
schools with regards to the racial distribution of teachers as well as any unobserved time invariant
student characteristics that may be correlated with race matching. Following a similar method from Jackson
(2018), I generate a behavior (using suspensions, absences, and grade retention) and a learning
skills (using GPA, marks for work habits, and marks for cooperation) index for each student and find
that race matched students in grades 6 through 12 are expected to increase in their behavioral
index by 0.041 standard deviations and increases in their learning skills index by 0.011 standard
deviations. My findings indicate that students of color also experience increases in the individual
components of GPA, work habits, and cooperation and see decreases in absenteeism
when matched with a teacher of the same race. I do not find statistically significant effects on any
of these outcomes for White students. Because noncognitive outcomes lead to higher high school
graduation rates, college enrollment rates, and wages (Heckman et al.,2013; Heckman et al., 2012;
Jackson, 2018), such effects could lead to a tightening in the achievement and wage gap found
between students of color and white students. This result can be achieved with an increase in
institutional efforts to ensure teacher populations more closely reflect that of their students.
