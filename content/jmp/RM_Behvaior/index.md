abstract: "Teachers are in a unique position to influence students during their most formative years. Despite empirical evidence that racial congruence improves student academic success via test scores (Egalite et al., 2011; Dee, 2004), nearly half of students in the US are students of color while only one in five US teachers are people of color (NCES, 2019). In this paper, I provide evidence that diversifying the labor supply of teachers to better reflect the racial distribution of students could lead to increases in outcomes for students of color without diminishing outcomes for white students. I use administrative data spanning from 2008 to 2018 within the Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the most racially diverse school districts in the country, to measure the effect of student-teacher race matching on various student non-test score outcomes. I mitigate the concern that race matches are endogenous by including school-grade and student fixed effects into a linear regression model. This setting accounts for any potential sorting that occurs across schools with regards to the racial distribution of teachers as well as any unobserved time invariant student characteristics that may be correlated with race matching. Following Jackson (2018), I generate a behavioral index for each student and find that race matched students of color see an average increase of 0.082 standard deviations (on par with the effect size found in Jackson's work) in this behavioral index. My findings indicate that students of color also experience increases in the disaggregated measures of GPA, effort level, and cooperation and see decreases in suspensions and absenteeism when matched with a teacher of the same race.  I do not find statistically significant effects on any of these outcomes for white students. Because these non-test score outcomes lead to higher high school graduation rates, college enrollment rates, and wages (Heckman et al.,2013; Heckman et al., 2012; Jackson, 2018), such effects could lead to a tightening in the achievement and wage gap found between students of color and white students. This result can be achieved with an increase in institutional efforts to ensure teacher populations more closely reflect that of their students."
